+ TV-L^2 (ROF) in [44] for denoising ( Du is the total variation of u)
	inf ( int(Du) + lamba*||v|| in L^2 sense)
	+ u is in BV class
	+ v is in L^2

		Nonlinera total variation based noise removal algorithm
		Physica D, 1992

+ TV-G (Meyer) ([37] lecture series)
	inf ( int(Du) + lamba * ||v|| in Banach space G contains signals
		with large oscillations (contains noise and textures)


+ TV-L1 to replace ROF to use L1 (L1 is suited for salt and pepper noise).

+ TV-Hilbert [44], [42]
	inf ( int(Du) + lamba * ||v|| in Hilbert space


If texture and structure are not correlated --> suggestion to obtain lamba
If not, select first local minimum.
